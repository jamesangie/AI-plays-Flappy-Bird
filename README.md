# AI-plays-Flappy-Bird
### The project is credit to the Youtuber Tech With Tim's AI Plays Flappy Bird - NEAT Python series. I used different implementation of objects and designing on my ideas other than his. NOT A SINGLE OF LETTER OF CODE IS COPIED AND PASTED
## 1. Implement the game(DONE)
### The game is implemented Objected Oriented. Everything is a class(object). It is easy to play: click mouse to jump the bird going through pipes to survive. There is no losing state since we want to train the AI we don't want to restart the game over and over
## 2. Create neural network(In Progress...)
### The neural network is set up using NEAT, which is a powerful module that we just need to input the correct data, the module will set up a neural network for us
## 3. Gathering training data(TODO)
