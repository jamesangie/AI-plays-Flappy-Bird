# AI-plays-Flappy-Bird
### The project is credit to the Youtuber Tech With Tim's AI Plays Flappy Bird - NEAT Python series. I used different implementation of objects and designing on my ideas other than his. NOT A SINGLE OF LETTER IS COPIED AND PASTED!
## 1. Implement the game(DONE)
### The game is implemented Objected Oriented. It is easy to play: click mouse to jump the bird going through pipes to survive. 
## 2. Create neural network(DONE)
### The neural network is set up using NEAT, which is a powerful module that we just need to input the correct data, the module will set up network for us(for more details: [NEAT](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_file.html)). I modified the game that it is now not playable by user, that now only my AI can play it. I set up rewards and punishments to train the AI. After a few training generations, we will get a winner who will be the best player of Flappy Bird in the world.
